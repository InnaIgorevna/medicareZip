<h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>

<p>We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website, including information:</p>
<ul>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUSTEDFORM SERVICE</h3>

<p>The TrustedForm Service independently verifies the origin of online sales leads through the use of proprietary JavaScript (“TrustedForm Script”) installed on a web page containing a contact request form (“Hosting Page”) on third-party websites. It captures what was viewed by the site visitor on the Hosting Page, as well as the site visitor’s real-time interactions with the Hosting Page, for example, clicks, mouse movements, and data inputs. The TrustedForm Script issues a digital certificate (“TrustedForm Certificate”) that contains this information for each site visitor and is passed with each lead collected on the Hosting Page as an additional data field. TrustedForm Certificates automatically expire within 3 days of being issued unless either claimed or having the claiming period extended for a 3 month period by a TrustedForm account holder (the “Claiming Period”). Once a Certificate has expired, it is permanently deleted. By claiming a TrustedForm Certificate, a TrustedForm account holder is able to verify the authenticity of the TrustedForm Certificate, extract the data from the TrustedForm Certificate, and store the TrustedForm Certificate in their TrustedForm account for future reference.  Claimed TrustedForm Certificates are stored as long as specified by the TrustedForm account holder.</p>
